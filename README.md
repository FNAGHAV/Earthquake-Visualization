# Earthquake Visualization

Background:
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) seeks to enhance public awareness and understanding of seismic activity worldwide. They require tools to visualize their earthquake data effectively for educational and informative purposes.

Project Overview:
This project aims to create an interactive earthquake visualization using data provided by the USGS. The visualization includes a map displaying earthquake locations, with markers representing magnitude and depth. Popups provide additional details when markers are clicked, and a legend offers context for the map data.

Earthquake Visualization
Get the earthquake dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed.
Import the data and visualize it on a Leaflet map.
Customize data markers based on earthquake magnitude and depth.
Include popups for additional earthquake information.
Create a legend for the map data.

This project demonstrates skills in data visualization, geospatial analysis, and web development.
